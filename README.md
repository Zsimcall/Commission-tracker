# Commission Tracker

This project provides a simple commission tracking tool with a Flask backend and a React frontâ€‘end.

The `backend/` folder contains the API server, while the static React app
is served from the `docs/` directory so it can be hosted on GitHub Pages.
Open `docs/index.html` to try the dashboard.
