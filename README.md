# Commission Tracker

This repository contains a prototype wireless commission tracking application.

The project currently includes:

- **backend/** – a small Flask API prototype.
- **frontend/** – a React interface used for testing CSV uploads and KPI display.
- **docs/** – a static placeholder page used for GitHub Pages deployments.

The implementation is incomplete but provides a starting point for parsing
commission CSV reports and displaying aggregated information.
